# Company info
Netflix is a platform where most people watch the trending movies and series.

# Problem statement
Using the data provided by Netflix, we are going to build a classification model to predict if the movie/series will receive award or not based on certain features such as IMDB rating, language, genre etc.

# Data Description
The data that will be used in this project has been downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ashishgup/netflix-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-imdb?select=netflix-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-imdb.csv). It includes 29 features such as: (Title, Gener, Director, etc.) for each Movie/Series.

# Algorithm
We are going to build different classification models, then we will choose the best model based on the classification metrics that we are going to use. Some feature engineering will be done to enhance the performance of the models.

# Tools
* Technologies: Python, Jupyter notebook.
* Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau.
