![Diabetes-Care-Plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63130647/145462347-2a3806ba-5dd7-4f7f-ad80-8249ae28b1cd.jpg)

# Overview 
As one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States, diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, affects the health of millions of people and puts an enormous financial burden on the US economy. We aimed to develop predictive models to identify risk factors for type 2 diabetes, which could help facilitate early diagnosis and intervention and also reduce medical costs.

# Questions
#### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) :
1. What are the risk factors most predictive of diabetes risk?
2. What is the most age of infection with diabetes?
3. What most genders to have diabetes?
#### Modeling :
1. Classify the people who have diabetes, prediabetes or don't have diabetes?
2. The most important factors that refer to prediabetes?
3. The main factors that effect on diabetes?

# Needs 
This model helps public health officials and the community to absorb and  predict the risks of diabetes and also contribute to spreading health awareness to reduce it.
